Graphing Calculator
With certain math topics like Quadratics being a hot topic, it is necessary that students, specifically that of high school, have a tool that would readily draw out a shape such as a parabola with inputs of coordinate points. This is why we, Team Binary Bears, decided to work together on a project that would act as a calculator and instantly provide the shape that two pairs of coordinate points would output. What this project basically does is that it self draws a grid that acts as a graph and then asks the user running the code for coordinate points and what equation they are using with the coordinates. The code then uses the coordinate points and the equation to draw out the shape that the solution will result in on the grid. Overall, the graphing calculator efficiently draws shapes on the graphs with mathematical data serving as a useful purpose for students to quickly get through the graphing process.
How to use
Getting to the process of using this code is fairly simple. All you need to do is to download the code files from github and then upload it into a Python editor such as pycharm. Uploading it into repl.it works as well.
How it works
The project works with a mix of visuals and common codes that simply as for the input. To add the visuals such as the grid and drawn shape, the turtle command was first imported into the code. After that, we drew the grid using the commands that the python turtle command would use to draw. Next we put in  commands to ask the user for an input and how to draw the shape of the line based on the input. All in all, the graphics drawn from importing the turtle python, the commands for implying the input, and teamwork made this project possible.
Technology
To make this project, we utilized the repl.it website as it was easier for all four of us to edit the code as we went along. Moreover, we used the pycharm editor to fix the bugs that the repl.it code had due to the repl.it editor having glitches. Lastly, we used a site that went over how to draw the visuals: https://realpython.com/beginners-guide-python-turtle/#programming-with-turtle
File Structure
For our project, we only have one file that holds and runs all of the code into the console. At the beginning of our file, we start off by doing the visuals and drawing the grid. After that we just input the simple commands such as asking the user for the input and directing how to draw out the output based on what the input is.
Problems
One of the major problems we faced was getting the code to correctly output the mathematical part of the code and how it would be displayed on the grid in the console. To solve this, we used teamwork and applied all of our ideas into correcting the bugs in our codes. We did this by experimenting multiple code lines to see which one worked better with all the types of graphing. Another problem we faced was how to make the program run smoothly and efficiently by fixing minor bugs in the code with the repl.it website getting glitchy. To resolve this, one person copied the code and switched to pycharm and shared the screen. This way we were able to get the bugs fixed more quickly and give all of our inputs into fixing the minor bugs. Hence, teamwork and individual ideas really helped us overcome the major problems we encountered as we coded our project.

Other (optional)
Issues 
For the most part, our project gives out the correct outputs and seems to have no bugs. However, there are usually an equation or two that would not have a clear solution.
Future lmprovements
If we had unlimited time, we would experiment more ways to find the solution mathematically and make sure we have a code with absolutely no bugs involved.
